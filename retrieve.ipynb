    "## Purpose\n",
    "The code implements an enhanced document retrieval system that combines vector similarity search with graph-based traversal to find relevant document chunks. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Search & Similarity Scoring**\n",
    " - Converts the input query into a vector embedding\n",
    " - Performs similarity search against entity nodes in Neo4j\n",
    " - Creates a sorted dictionary of entity IDs and their similarity scores\n",
    " - Filters results based on a similarity threshold (default 0.8)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Traversal Strategy**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    MATCH path = (n:Chunk)-[*1..{max_hops}]->(m:`__Entity__`)\n",
    "    WHERE m.id IN $ids\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Finds paths from document chunks to relevant entities\n",
    " - Limits path length to control traversal depth\n",
    " - Only considers entities that met the similarity threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relevance Calculation**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    WITH n, min(length(path)) as distance, m\n",
    "    WITH n, distance, m.id as entity_id\n",
    "    WITH n, distance, entity_id, \n",
    "            CASE \n",
    "            WHEN entity_id IN $ids \n",
    "            THEN $similarity_scores[entity_id]\n",
    "            END as similarity\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Calculates shortest path length to each entity\n",
    " - Preserves original similarity scores from vector search\n",
    " - Combines structural proximity (distance) with semantic similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Ordering**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    ORDER BY similarity DESC, distance\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Prioritizes chunks with higher semantic similarity\n",
    " - Uses path distance as a secondary sorting criterion\n",
    " - Ensures most relevant chunks appear first\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Format**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    RETURN n.text, n.fileName, n.page_number, n.position, entity_id, similarity\n",
    "```\n",
    " - Returns comprehensive chunk metadata:\n",
    "    - Text content\n",
    "    - Source file name\n",
    "    - Page number\n",
    "    - Position in document\n",
    "    - Associated entity ID\n",
    "    - Similarity score\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Hybrid retrieval approach combining:\n",
    "    - Vector-based semantic search\n",
    "    - Graph-based structural relationships\n",
    "- Configurable parameters:\n",
    "    - Similarity threshold\n",
    "    - Maximum path length\n",
    "    - Result limit\n",
    "- Deduplication of chunks\n",
    "- Ordered results by relevance\n",
    "- Rich metadata for each chunk"

    "- The query finds chunks that are connected to relevant entities either:\n",
    "    - Directly (1 relationship away)\n",
    "    - Through intermediate nodes (up to max_hops relationships away)\n",
    "- This broadens the search context while maintaining control over the search depth\n",

    "**Practical Impact**\n",

    "    # With max_hops = 1 (direct connections only)\n",
    "    Chunk -> Entity\n",
    "\n",
    "    # With max_hops = 2 (includes indirect connections)\n",
    "    Chunk -> IntermediateNode -> Entity\n",
