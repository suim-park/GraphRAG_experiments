Several factors may explain why our findings  differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous  multicenter trial that showed a benefit with  early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First,  we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups  to test our intervention in the context of best  care and to reduce the likelihood of differential  PEEP use across groups.

Several factors may explain why our findings  differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous  multicenter trial that showed a benefit with  early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First,  we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups  to test our intervention in the context of best  care and to reduce the likelihood of differential  PEEP use across groups.
