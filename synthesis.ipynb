Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting selective α2 adrenergic receptor agonist with both  analgesic and sedative effects, and, unlike other sedatives, does not depress the respiratory  drive [26]. While originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for short- term use, multiple clinical trials have subsequently demonstrated its efficacy and safety  when used for longer term sedation in the ICU [17,18,22,23]. The main side effects of  dexmedetomidine are bradycardia, hypotension and the potential for withdrawal symptoms  upon discontinuation of long-term therapy [17,18]. When compared to other sedatives,  dexmedetomidine has been shown to result in a more awake and interactive patient, a lower  incidence of delirium, more ventilator free days, and less days in the ICU [17–'), ('FMWSCPARDS.pdf', ' Prevalence of new shock in FACTT Lite (9%) was lower than in FACTT Conservative  (13%) (p = 0.007 vs Lite) and similar to FACTT Liberal (11%) (p = 0.18 vs Lite).

When compared to  the dosage used in 3 RCTs [3, 8, 20] showing a beneficial  effect of NMBAs in ARDS patients, our nurse protocol  based on TOF monitoring allowed a 60% reduction in the  overall cisatracurium consumption. Moreover, in most  cases, an effective neuromuscular block was obtained  starting from the first hour, and modification of posology  was not needed in 60% of patients. In ARDS, the reduction in sedation posology and the  algorithm-based management of sedation permitted a  reduction in mortality [21]. In 2004, Baumann et\\xa0al. [13]  concluded that TOF monitoring had no effect either  on NMBA consumption or on recovery time compared  to clinical assessment. Similar results had been found  in a study by Strange et\\xa0al.

CONCLUSIONS: Early 48-hour NMBAs infusion in patients with moderate to severe ARDS was associated with re\\xad duced ICU mortality without improvement in oxygenation, VFDs, 28-day and 90-day mortality. It did not contribute  significantly to ICU-AW. Based on these results, NMBAs infusion is recommended for moderate to severe ARDS for its  short-term benefit in early phase of disease. Prolonged use of NMBAs beyond 48 hours requires further study. (Cite this article as: Lyu T, Lee YS, Dhanvijay S, Freebairn R.
